Link to the dataset as given in mail: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud 

I had written the code for ".csv" file downloaded from above link.

Also, from the analysis of the given data:
Lets's consider this
		            Prediction fraud(+)     Prediction not fraud(-)
Fraud(+)	      True Positive		        False Negative
Not Fraud(-)    False Positive		      True Negative

FOR UNBALANCED DATA:
			                  Precision   Recall    F1-Score
Shallow_nn		             0.75      0.89      0.81 
logistic_Regression        0.76      0.70      0.73
Random_Forest		           0.80      0.65      0.72

Clearly validating by different models, we found 
for F1-score: Shallow_nn > logistic_Regression > Random_Forest
for Recall  : Shallow_nn > logistic_Regression > Random_Forest
for Precision:Shallow_nn < logistic_Regression < Random_Forest

While for Balanced Data:
