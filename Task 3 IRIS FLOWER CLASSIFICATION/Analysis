By analysis of the data and using different models:

The accuracy of different models are as follows for the test data:
DecisionTree_Accuracy:  97.77%
LogisticRegression_Accuracy:  95.55%
KNeighborsClassifier_Accuracy:  91.11%

This clearly implies that the accuracy of DecisionTree > LogisticRegression > KNeighborsClassifier.
Furthermore this accuracy may vary slightly as the train data and test data are splitted randomly.
